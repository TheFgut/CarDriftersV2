# Car drifters
A minimalist arcade-style game where cars move along concentric circular tracks. The player controls one car and must switch between circles at the right moments — avoiding collisions and reaching the finish.
## Gameplay
Сars continuously move along a series of concentric circular tracks. The player controls a single car and must skillfully switch between circles at the right transition points to avoid collisions with other vehicles. As the player navigates outward through the rings, the goal is to reach the final outer circle without crashing. Strategic timing and spatial awareness are key to progressing safely through the increasingly busy lanes.
